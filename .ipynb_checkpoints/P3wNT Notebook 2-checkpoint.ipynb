This is called [busy waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting), and your computer will essentially be busy waiting forever.  The other problem is that your loop is printing more and more lines of text into the notebook.  This could easily crash your web browser, which is trying to store and display zillions of lines of numbers.  So be ready for problems!  "
