    "In this notebook, we introduce cryptography -- how to communicate securely over insecure channels.  We begin with a study of two basic ciphers, the Caesar cipher and its fancier variant, the Vigenère cipher.  The Vigenère cipher uses a **key** to turn **plaintext** (i.e., the  message) into **ciphertext** (the coded message), and uses the same key to turn the ciphertext back into plaintext.  Therefore, two parties can communicate securely if they -- and only they -- possess the key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the security of communication rests on possession of a common key, then we're left with a new problem:  how do the two parties agree on a common key, especially if they are far apart and communicating over an insecure channel?  \n",
    "\n",
    "A clever solution to this problem was published in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, and so it's called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  It takes advantage of modular arithmetic:  the existence of a primitive root (modulo a prime) and the difficulty of solving the **discrete logarithm** problem.  \n",

    "A cipher is a way of transforming a message, called the **plaintext** into a different form, the **ciphertext**, which conceals the meaning to all but the intended recipient(s).  A cipher is a *code*, and can take many forms.  A **substitution cipher** might simply change every letter to a different letter in the alphabet.  This is the idea behind \"Cryptoquip\" puzzles.  These are not too hard for people to solve, and are easy for computers to solve, using frequency analysis (understanding how often different letters or letter-combinations occur).\n",

    "Even though substitution ciphers are easy to break, they are a good starting point.  To implement substitution ciphers in Python, we need to study the *string* type in a bit more detail.  To declare a string variable, just put your string in quotes.  You can use any letters, numbers, spaces, and many symbols inside a string.  You can enclose your string by single quotes, like `'Hello'` or double-quotes, like `\"Hello\"`.  This flexibility is convenient, if you want to *use* quotes within your string.  For example, the string *Prince's favorite prime is 1999* should be described in Python with double-quotes `\"Prince's favorite prime is 1999\"` so that the apostrophe doesn't confuse things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are indexed, and their letters can be retrieved as if the string were a *list* of letters.  Python experts will note that strings are *immutable* while lists are *mutable* objects, but we aren't going to worry about that here."

    "Since computers store data in binary, the designers of early computers (1960s) created a code called [**ASCII**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) to associate to each character a number between 0 and 127.  Every number between 0 and 127 is represented in binary by 7 bits (between 0000000 and 1111111), and so each character is stored with 7 bits of memory.  Later, ASCII was extended with another 128 characters, so that codes between 0 and 255 were used, requiring 8 bits.  8 bits of memory is called a **byte**.  One byte of memory suffices to store one (extended ASCII) character.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that there are 256 ASCII codes available, but there are fewer than 256 characters available on your keyboard, even once you include symbols like `#` and `;`.  Some of these \"extra\" codes are for accented letters, and others are relics of old computers.  For example, ASCII code 7 (0000111) stands for the \"bell\", and older readers might remember making the Apple II computer beep by pressing Control-G on the keyboard (\"G\" is the 7th letter).  You can look up a [full ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com/) if you're curious.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, the global community of computer users requires far more than 256 \"letters\" -- there are many alphabets around the world!  So instead of ASCII, we can access over 100 thousand **unicode** characters.  Scroll through a [unicode table](https://unicode-table.com/en/) to see what is possible.  In Python version 3.x, all strings are considered in Unicode, but in Python 2.7 (which we use), it's a bit trickier to work with Unicode.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we stay within ASCII codes, since they will suffice for basic English messages.  Python has built-in commands `chr` and `ord` for converting from code-number (0--255) to character and back again."
