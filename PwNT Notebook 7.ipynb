    "In the previous notebook, we studied a few basic ciphers together with Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  The Vigenère cipher we studied uses a **secret key** for encrypting and decrypting messages.  The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, so we say it is a **symmetric key** cipher.  In order for two parties to share the same secret key, we studied the Diffie-Hellman protocol, whose security rests on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this represents progress towards secure communication, it is particularly vulnerable to problems of authentication.  For example, imagine a \"man-in-the-middle attack\":  Alice and Bob wish to communicate securely, and begin the Diffie-Hellman protocol over an insecure line.  But **Eve** has intercepted the line.  To Alice, she pretends to be Bob, and to Bob, she pretends to be Alice.  She goes through the Diffie-Hellman protocol with each, obtaining two secret keys, and decrypting/encrypting messages as they pass through her computer.  In this way, Alice and Bob think they are talking to each other, but Eve is just passing (and understanding) their messages the whole time!\n",
    "\n",
    "To thwart such an attack, we need some type of authentication.  We need something **asymmetric** -- something one person can do that no other person can do, like a verifiable signature, so that we can be sure we're communicating with the intended person.  For such a purpose, we introduce the RSA cryptosystem.  Computationally based on modular exponentiation, its security rests on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.\n",

While Diffie-Hellman is used for symmetric key cryptography (using the same key to encrypt and decrypt), the RSA protocol has two keys:  a **public key** that can be used by anyone for encryption and a **private key** that can be used by its owner for decryption.  \n",

    "That's the entire process of encryption and decryption.  Encryption requires just the public key $(N,e)$ and decryption requires the private key $(p,q)$ too.  Everything else is modular arithmetic, using Euler's theorem and the Euclidean algorithm to find modular multiplicative inverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical standpoint, there are many challenges, and we just mention a few here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key generation:**  The person who constructs the private key $(p,q)$ needs to be careful.  The primes $p$ and $q$ need to be pretty large (512 bits, or 1024 bits perhaps), which is not so difficult.  They also need to be constructed **randomly**.  For imagine that Alice comes up with her private key $(p,q)$ and Anne comes up with her private key $(q,r)$, with the same prime $q$ in common.  Their public keys will include the numbers $N = pq$ and $M = qr$.  If someone like Arjen comes along and starts taking GCDs of all the public keys in a database, that person will stumble upon the fact that $GCD(N,M) = q$, from which the private keys $(p,q)$ and $(q,r)$ can be derived.  And this sort of disaster has happened!  Poorly generated keys were stored in a database, and [discovered by Arjen Lenstra et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/064.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security by difficulty of factoring:**  The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of obtaining the private key $(p,q)$ from the public key $(N,e)$.  Since $N = pq$, this is precisely the difficulty of factoring a large number $N$ into two primes (given the knowledge that it is the product of two primes).  Currently it seems very difficult to factor large numbers.  The RSA factoring challenges give monetary rewards for factoring such large $N$.  The record (2017) is factoring a [768-bit (232 digit) number, RSA-768](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-768).  For this reason, we may consider a 1024-bit number secure for now (i.e. $p$ and $q$ are 512-bit primes), or use a 2048-bit number if we are paranoid.  If quantum computers develop sufficiently, they could make factoring large numbers easy, and RSA will have to be replaced by a quantum-secure protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Web of Trust:**  Trust needs to begin somewhere.  Every time Alice and Bob communicate, Alice should not come up with a new private key, and give Bob the new public key.  For if they are far apart, how does Bob know he's receiving Alice's public key and not talking to an eavesdropper Eve?  Instead, it is better for Alice to register (in person, perhaps) her public key at some time.  She can create her private key $(p,q)$ and register the resulting public key $(N,e)$ with some \"key authority\" who checks her identity at the time.  The key authority then stores everyone's public keys -- effectively they say \"if you want to send a secure message to Alice, use the following public key:  (..., ...)\"  Then Bob can consult the key authority when he wishes to communicate securely to Alice, and this private/public key combination can be used for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as one might guess, this kicks the trust question to another layer.  How does Bob know he's communicating with the key authority?  The key authorities need to have their own authentication mechanism, etc..  One way to avoid going down a rabbithole of mistrust is to *distribute* trust across a network of persons.  Instead of a centralized \"key authority\", one can distribute one's public keys across an entire network of communicators (read about [openPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP)).  Then Bob, if he wishes, can double-check Alice's public keys against the records of numerous members of the network -- assuming that hackers haven't gotten to all of them!  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, some implementations of RSA use a more centralized authority and others rely on a web of trust.  Cryptography requires a clever application of modular arithmetic (in Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and many other systems), but also a meticulous approach to implementation.  Often the challenges of implementation introduce new problems in number theory."

One can convert those 512 bits into 64 bytes (512/8 = 64) which can be viewed as a 64-character string via ASCII.  This 64-byte string is called the *digest* of the hash.
